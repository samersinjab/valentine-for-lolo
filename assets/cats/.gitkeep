# Cat Photos Directory

This directory is for your personal cat photos (optional).

## How to Add Your Photos:

1. Add 3-4 cat photos in JPEG or PNG format
2. Recommended names:
   - your-photo-1.jpg (pleading/cute cat)
   - your-photo-2.jpg (sad cat)
   - your-photo-3.jpg (happy cat)
   - your-photo-4.jpg (loving cat)

3. Optimize your photos:
   - Recommended size: 500x500px
   - File size: < 500KB each
   - Use tools like TinyPNG or Squoosh to compress

4. Update script.js with your photo paths:
   ```javascript
   catImages: {
       pleading: 'assets/cats/your-photo-1.jpg',
       sad: 'assets/cats/your-photo-2.jpg',
       happy: 'assets/cats/your-photo-3.jpg',
       love: 'assets/cats/your-photo-4.jpg'
   }
   ```
