# Particles Directory

This directory is reserved for particle effect assets if needed.

Currently, the website uses:
- CSS-based particle animations
- Emoji particles (hearts, sparkles) rendered dynamically
- No external assets required

This directory can be used for:
- Custom particle sprites
- SVG animations
- Additional visual effects

Note: The current implementation doesn't require any files in this directory.
